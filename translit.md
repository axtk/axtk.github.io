# *Venedica*, nový translit

[ve <ins>ne</ins> di t͡sa]

*A project of a consistent transliteration system of the Cyrillic script*

This transliteration system:

- doesn't seek to follow the patterns typical of the English orthography, with the reasons for this being:
  - following English patterns results in inconsistencies (e.g. using *-y* as a transliteration for *-й*, *-ы*, *-ий*, or *-ый*; cf. *\*Valday*, *\*Andrey*, *\*Dmitry*, *\*Mirny*);
  - mimicking the English orthography while using consonant clusters like *zh*, *shch*, *kh* still ends up in a writing deeply foreign for an English speaker;
- is aligned with the Latin-scripted Slavic languages, such as Czech, Slovak, Slovene, and to some extent Polish, with the reasons for this being:
  - these languages have a similar phonetic system and they already have well-established patterns for representing the phonetic features typical of the Slavic languages;
  - writing all Slavic languages in a similar mutually intelligible way should contribute to a better understanding between speakers of these languages.

#### Pre-reform spelling (before 1917)

| *Cyr* | *Lat* ||
|:----:|:----:|---|
| і | **i** ||
|   | **í** | long *i*, for [i] before or after a vowel and for *ій* |

- Cyr. *іи* &rarr; Lat. *ii*: a long *í* is redundant here;
- Cyr. *ѣ* &rarr; Lat. *iě*: due to the probable historical pronunciation being close to [ie], and its cursive form resembling the ligature of *іь* (with the Old Russian vowel *ь* represented as *ě*); this form also combines the two major phonetic realizations: as [i] in the southwest of the East Slavic dialect continuum and [ʲe] elsewhere.

## Background

The transliteration system is fully described by the tables above. This section is a little step into the historical background of its features.

The phonetic value of most Latin characters in the Slavic languages is quite predictable without prior knowledge of the Slavic writing systems, but like in many Latin-scripted languages there is a number of extra features requiring some remarks.

### *č*, *š*, *ž*

These characters stand for *ч* [tʃ], *ш* [ʃ], and *ж* [ʐ] respectively. The caron, the diacritic mark, in these characters indicates their affinity with the unmarked consonants, which can be seen for instance in Russian word forms like *возить*&nbsp;— *вожу* *(z/ž)*, *писать*&nbsp;— *пишу* *(s/š)*, *улица*&nbsp;— *уличный* *(c/č)*. This also means that, in many contexts, typing with a keyboard lacking the accented characters shouldn't render a text completely incomprehensible.

### *ŝ*

This character stands for *щ* [Rus. ɕ; Ukr. ʃt͡ʃ] and resembles *š* standing for *ш* [ʃ] both phonetically and graphically.

### *j*

This character represents the [j]-sound (*й*), like in all Latin-scripted Slavic languages (as well as in most Germanic languages).

### *y*

This character represents the [ɨ]-sound (Rus., Bel. *ы*, Ukr. *и*), like in Polish.

### *c*, *h*

These characters represent the [t͡s] (*ц*) and [x] (*х*) sounds respectively. The *ts* and *kh* digraphs, that tend to be used as the representations of these sounds in some transliteration systems, are only reasonable in the writing systems where the standalone characters of *c* and *h* are already reserved to represent other sounds (as in English and French), while in the mentioned transliteration systems the standalone *c* and *h* are left completely unused. The *c* character also stands for the [t͡s] sound in all Latin-scripted Slavic languages (as in the Polish words *ulica*, *centralny*) and is part of the *č* character representing its palatalized counterpart (pronounced as [tʃ], *ч*).

### *ja*, *ia*

The sounds corresponding to the characters *я*, *е*, *ё*, *ю* are represented as *j* + vowel in the Slavic languages: *ja*, *je*, *jo*, *ju* (as in the name *Jan*) when the [j] sound is actually present: word-initially, after a vowel, after the soft sign *ь* and the hard sign *ъ*, after the apostrophe *'* (*j* appears in the beginning of a syllable). After the palatalized (softened) consonants these characters no longer contain the [j] sound and, for this reason, they are represented with *ia*, *ie*, *iu*, *io* (like in Polish), where the leading *i* marks the preceding consonant as softened. (Examples in Russian: *Jaroslavĺ*, *Riazań*.) However, in Russian, the Cyrillic *е* after consonants stands for both [ʲe] (as in *тесто* [tʲestə]) and [e] (as in *тест* [test]) which is the reason why *ie* and *e* merge into a single representation *e* after consonants. Also, by far higher frequency of the palatalizing *e* in Russian renders the palatalization marker *i* redundant. In the beginning of a syllable, Russian Cyrillic *е* is still represented as *je*.

### *ń*

The acute accent above consonants represents soft consonants not followed by a vowel (as in Polish *Poznań*).

### *í*, *ý*

These characters stand for the long vowels in the Czech and Slovak orthographies: *dobrý den*, *Letní stadion*, *Průmyslový palác*. In the East Slavic languages, these long vowels represent [ij] (*ий*) and [ɨj] (*ый*) respectively (resulting in the same rendering of *dobrý* for Rus. *добрый* and Ukr. *добрий*). The plain *i* next to other vowels represents the *short i*: it is either the palatalization marker (as in *R**i**azań*) or the [j] sound (as in *Alta**i***). The *long i* is also a way to convey the full [i] sound next to other vowels (which is less frequently encountered in the East Slavic languages, as in *Tro**í**ck*, in contrast to *tro**i**ka*).

### Underline as a stress mark

The acute accent _́  is often used as a stress mark over vowels, which would conflict with the diacritic marks on certain characters. On the other hand, there is in fact a better alternative: the underline.

The underline as a stress mark
- is also immediately perceived as an emphasis mark;
- doesn't conflict with most diacritics;
- can be used to put a stress on a vowel sound represented by more than one letter (*Vanc<ins>ou</ins>ver*, *Montr<ins>eu</ins>x*) or on a whole stressed syllable;
- fits for stressed syllabic consonants (like in the Czech river name *V<ins>l</ins>tava*);
- fits for most writing systems, including consonantal abjads (like Arabic and Hebrew);
- and being part of the markup doesn't introduce and extra character into the text.
