# From *cantare* to *chanter*

The transition of the Vulgar Latin sound /k/ into /s/, /ʃ/, and /tʃ/ in French and Italian is a well-known fact, but how exactly did it happen?

This transition is seen, for instance, in *centum* > *cent*, *cantare* > *chanter* in French, and *centum* > *cento* in Italian, and the generally accepted view of these transformations is the following:

/k/ > /kʲ/ > /tʲ/ > /ts/ > /s/ &mdash; in Lat. *centum* > Fr. *cent*,<br>
/k/ > /tʃ/ > /ʃ/ &mdash; in Lat. *centum* > It. *cento* and Lat. *cantare* > Fr. *chanter*.

One of the curious parts of these chains is /kʲ/ > /tʲ/. If there is nothing in between, it suggests that at some point in time speakers of Vulgar Latin regarded /kʲ/ and /tʲ/ as close variations of the same sound while speaking to each other. There is not much detail on how this could happen, apart from attributing this change to a shift of the point of articulation that would only take place in certain phonetic environments (see, for instance, Elcock *The Romance languages*, [p. 53](https://github.com/axtk/w/blob/main/_res/palatalization.png?raw=true)).

On the other hand, the example of phonetic variation in the Modern German dialects seems to offer a different perspective. The sound pronounced as /ç/ in Standard German, as in *ich*, is rendered as /k/ and /kʲ/ in Low German, /ɕ/ (and in certain conditions /j/) in Kölsch and other Central German dialects. A similar phonetic variation is seen with the adjectival suffix *-ig*. With all of these variants still observed in the living language varieties, this can provide a credible insight to the possible transformations of the /k/ sound.

Since similar phonetic patterns often reoccur across different language groups, the sound change from Vulgar Latin /k/ to French /ʃ/ could have passed in the following steps:

/k/ > /kʲ/ > /ç/ > /ɕ/ > /ʃ/, as in *cantare* > *chanter*.

In this chain, each pair of the neighboring sounds are close allophones that could be taken for a single phoneme by speakers of the language, as proven by modern Germans. The other possibilities of the development of Vulgar Latin /k/ observable in French can also be aligned with this chain:

/k/ > /kʲ/ > /ç/ > /ɕ/ > /sʲ/ > /s/, as in *centum* > *cent*,<br>
/k/ > /kʲ/ > /ç/ > /j/ > /∅/, as in *facere* > *faire*.

### Related phonetic changes

(1) The above chains can also be adjusted to fit Italian:

/k/ > /k/, unchanged as in *cantare*,<br>
/k/ > /kʲ/ > /ç/ > /ɕ/ > /tɕ/ > /tʃ/, as in *centum* > *cento*.

(2) Similarly, a /tɕ/ or /tʃ/ sound could have emerged from /ɕ/ in varieties of Old French, not as a predecessor of /ʃ/, but as a regional alternative. This particular variant could have survived in English borrowings like *chair* and *chamber*.

(3) The sound change /k/ > /ts/ occurring in other languages could have resulted from a further development of /tɕ/ in the same sound chain.
