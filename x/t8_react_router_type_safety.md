[`@t8/react-router`](https://github.com/t8js/react-router#readme) offers type-safe routing as an optional enhancement, allowing for gradual adoption of type-safe routing throughout the app, while keeping the routing simple. It's achieved by entrusting route typing to an external type-safe URL builder, such as the `url()` function below, and by enabling the same routing APIs to accept the values created by the URL builder with regard to the typing.

Here's an example (based on the one discussed in the [T8 React Router overview](/x/t8_react_router#routing-example)):

```tsx
import {A, useRoute} from '@t8/react-router';
import {createURLSchema} from 'url-shape';
import {z} from 'zod';

const {url} = createURLSchema({
    '/': null, // goes without parameters
    '/sections/:id': {
        params: z.object({
            id: z.coerce.number(),
        }),
    },
    '/search': {
        query: z.object({
            term: z.string(),
            lang: z.optional(z.enum(['current', 'all'])),
        }),
    },
});

let App = () => {
    let {withRoute} = useRoute();

    // `withRoute(routePattern, x, y)` acts similarly to
    // `matchesRoutePattern ? x : y`
    return (
        <>
            <header className={withRoute(url('/'), 'full', 'compact')}>
                <h1>App</h1>
                <nav>
                    <A href={url('/')}>
                        Intro
                    </A>
                    {' | '}
                    <A href={url('/sections/:id', {params: {id: 1}})}>
                        Start
                    </A>
                </nav>
            </header>
            {withRoute(url('/'), (
                <main>
                    <h1>Intro</h1>
                </main>
            ))}
            {withRoute(url('/sections/:id'), ({params}) => (
                <main>
                    <h1>Section {params.id}</h1>
                </main>
            ))}
        </>
    );
};
```

[Live demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/vgt64k?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx)

The URL schema (defined with Zod or Yup) is transparent and easy to follow, nothing is implied under the hood, no opaquely inherited parameters. The URL schema doesn't have to cover the entire app, the schema can be split into parts covering standalone portions of the app for better readability and maintainability.

The ternary route matching function `withRoute(routePattern, x, y)` passes the route types provided by the `url()` function to its parameters. A type-aware code editor expects `params.id` in `<h1>Section {params.id}</h1>` to be a `number`, just as the URL schema suggests.

Although not a requirement, we might want to cover the entire app with type-safe routes. Once we've done that, we might want to disallow plain `string` and `RegExp` URLs and URL patterns created outside the URL builder (the `url()` function) to enforce type-safe routing further on. This can be done by overriding the router's type config:

```ts
declare module '@t8/react-router' {
    interface Config {
        strict: true;
    }
}
```

The incremental approach of `@t8/react-router` to type-safe routing, from a partial URL schema to strict application-wide type safety, makes it easier to adopt and maintain.
